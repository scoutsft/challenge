**Inventory Management Application**



An online seller fulfills customer orders placed on the seller&#39;s website and maintains stock of multiple products in their warehouse. The online seller uses inventory management software to accomplish these needs.

The warehouse is divided into multiple bins (shelves or areas of the warehouse) to hold inventory. A bin can contain multiple different products, and a product can have inventory in multiple different bins.

Your task is to design an application, either a REST API or a Web Application, using your language and framework of choice, that will allow warehouse staff to view, create, edit, and delete: Products, Bins, Inventory Levels, and Orders. Data should be stored in a SQL database of your choice.

While we encourage using C# and Microsoft SQL Server, please use whatever language and SQL database you are most comfortable with.


**Project Submission**

Completed submissions can be submitted via a fork on the project, or via email.
Please provide your database as a collection of scripts in a .sql file, rather than a database (ie .mdf) file
